# CarnaticMusicTranscriptor

Hello all,
I was inspired to pursue this project by this YouTube video of Jeff Heaton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj9NOiFLxWA 

The main aim of the Carnatic Music Transcriptor is to extract notes from an audio snippet primarily belonging to Carnatic Music (South Indian Classical Music).
I re-mapped the notes to suit the Carnatic System of Music for better visualisation and understanding of viewers, recorded my own music samples which include violin and vocal genres.
The present code is works best in the octave range of C shruti (~132 Hz). 
I have extensively used this code, to extract notes and observe the complex frequencies behind the Indian Tanpura, Harmonies, the behaviour of strings of the violin, tried famous theme music and songs for demo purposes.
I have included suitable comments within the code to help anyone understand and implement the code.

I hope this helps Indian Classical Music students in better visualising, understanding and viewing the frequencies / swaras which make up the complex melodies of Carnatic Music.
Open to discuss ideas to improve and expand the scope of the project!!
