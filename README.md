# CarnaticMusicTranscriptor

Hello all,
I was inspired to pursue this project by this YouTube video of Jeff Heaton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj9NOiFLxWA 

The main aim of the Carnatic Music Transcriptor is to extract notes from an audio snippet primarily belonging to Carnatic Music (South Indian Classical Music).
I re-mapped the notes to suit the Carnatic System of Music for better visualisation and understanding of viewers, recorded my own music samples which include violin and vocal genres.
The present code is works best in the octave range of C shruti (~132 Hz). 
I have extensively used this code, to extract notes and observe the complex frequencies behind the Indian Tanpura, Harmonies, the behaviour of strings of the violin, tried famous theme music and songs for demo purposes.
I have included suitable comments within the code to help anyone understand and implement the code.

Carnatic music can consist of many notes in a single frame, and I wanted to capture them all in order to give the viewer the best visual experience, aiding their learning process. This prompted me to manually map each MIDI number and frequency to the corresponding Carnatic swara/note. 
I also handled the edge cases, by recording certain audio files on my violin and making sure the transcription works when multiple octaves, polyphony and imperfect notes are involved too! Here is the link for the video and corresponding screenshot of a demo visualisation of the BBC Sherlock title track recorded on my violin: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11quJyEt5QKsK2SSkeUD7OF53pn88hYG1/view?usp=sharing

I hope this helps Indian Classical Music students in better visualising, understanding and viewing the frequencies / swaras which make up the complex melodies of Carnatic Music.
Open to discuss ideas to improve and expand the scope of the project!!
